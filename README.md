# Notes of Recursive Estimation

These are my notes of the course Recursive Estimation (151-0566-00L, spring semester 2023) by Dr. D'Andrea at ETH ZÃ¼rich. The file can be made into 2 **dense** pages by changing the line at the beginning of the document to
```tex
\setboolean{examprint}{true}
```
and then running
```
$ pdfjam RecursiveEstimation.pdf 2- --nup 2x2 --outfile RecursiveEstimation2P.pdf
```
